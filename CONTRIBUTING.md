# How to run ?

- Use python==3.9

# How to submit ?

- Once the code is modified please do comment out the function of what that part of code does (1 or 2 lines will be more than enough)
- Concentrate on improving the code try to optimize it as much as possible
- Do try checking out with your local computer (as we just use python3.9) not much of an issue if not used under venv 
- Attach an image if possible .. will look good (first impression sort of?)
